# Graph------

# A graph Consists of two thinga
# A set V of element called nodes 
#  A set E of edges such that each edges e in E is identified with a unidque (unorderd) pair [v1,v2] af node in v denoted by e = [U,V] 
#  - We indeicate the parts of the graph by writing G = (V1,E)

# **If deg(u) = 0 ,then u is called isolated node

# **Path***

# --> A path of length n from a node u to node v is defined as a sequence of n + 1 nodes.

#  p = (v0,v1,v2,......Vn)

# The path is said to be closed if v0 = vn


# Simple and Complex path
#  Connected Graph
# Tree Graph
# Labelled Graph ---> A graph is to be labelled if its edges are assigned data.
# Weighted Graph
# Multiple edeges
# Loop ---> An edge is called loop if it has identical end points.
# Multi Graph
# Directed Graph
# Complete graph
